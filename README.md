# Shared library dependencies for NETCONF-related software

Please note that a `Verified: +1` vote only means that all these libraries managed to build.
There's no cross-project gating right now.

## Updating software

When uploading, make sure that all changes share the same topic in Gerrit (e.g., `git push ... -o topic=update-netconf`).

1) Make a modification here in `CzechLight/dependencies`.
This will be the change **A** ([example](https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/dependencies/+/2693)).

2) Push commits to all "leaf" repositories (changes **B**, **C**, **D**, **E**, **F**):

- `CzechLight/cla-sysrepo`
- `CzechLight/netconf-cli`
- `CzechLight/velia`
- `CzechLight/rousette`
- `CzechLight/sysrepo-ietf-alarms`

If no actual changes are needed, feel free to use `git commit --allow-empty`.
Use these `Depends-on` footer tags:
```shell
Depends-on: https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/dependencies/+/${A}
```

If you're feeling particularly lucky (are you, punk?), sometimes it might be safe to skip commits to repositories which are "obviously not affected" by the dependency update.
If you do that, keep in mind that you're bypassing automation which was put in place for a good reason.
If stuff breaks, you will have to keep all the pieces.

3) Finally, update `CzechLight/br2-external` so that it includes all changes made above ([example](https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/br2-external/+/2698)).
The following `Depends-on` are needed:
```shell
Depends-on: https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/dependencies/+/${A}
Depends-on: https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/cla-sysrepo/+/${B}
Depends-on: https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/netconf-cli/+/${C}
Depends-on: https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/velia/+/${D}
Depends-on: https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/rousette/+/${E}
Depends-on: https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/sysrepo-ietf-alarms/+/${F}
```

If everything builds, then the change is good to go üåà ü¶Ñ üçª.

## Adding new repositories

- Create project within Gerrit: `ssh import.gerrit.cesnet.cz gerrit create-project --parent github/acl github/ORGANIZATION/REPO --owner '"Git Importers"' --description "'MIRROR: ...'"`
- Run the first import script as the `github-mirror` user on `gerrit.cesnet.cz`: `REPO=org/repo ./oneshot.sh`
- Update configuration of the `public` tenant in Zuul ([example](https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/ci/project-config/+/2188))
- Reconfigure Zuul (as `zuul` on `zuul.gerrit.cesnet.cz`, run `zuul-scheduler full-reconfigure`)
- Add the submodule here: `git submodule add ../../github/ORG/REPO REPO`
- Modify `ci/build.sh` to start building this dependency
- Propose changes to all consumers as shown above

## Testing experimental changes

When an upstream project fixes a bug or implements a suggestion that we asked for, their commits typically end up in their GitHub repo, but not neccessarily in a branch that we're tracking.
Also, the CI builds against a Gerrit copy of these projects, and the mirroring script only runs twice a day.
In order to test changes earlier, all CzechLight developers can push changes to branches named `cesnet/*`.
E.g., changes to `libyang` can be pushed to the repo `github/CESNET/libyang`, branch `cesnet/2020-07-24-fix-random-stuff`.
