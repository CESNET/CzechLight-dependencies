# Shared library dependencies for NETCONF-related software

Please note that a `Verified: +1` vote only means that all these libraries managed to build.
There's *some* cross-project checking, but it is currently not enforced.
Since Zuul+Gerrit do not support "atomic cross-repo changes" and there will be occasional changes which require updates of multiple repositories, use caution.

## Updating software

When uploading, make sure that all changes share the same topic in Gerrit (e.g., `git push ... -o topic=update-netconf`).

1) Make a modification here in `CzechLight/dependencies`.
This will be the change **A**.
A subset of build targets of "downstream procjets" will be rebuilt.
Those which have failed require follow-up commits.

2) Push commits to all "leaf" repositories (changes **B**, **C**, **D**, **E**, **F**) which require modifications:

- `CzechLight/cla-sysrepo`
- `CzechLight/netconf-cli`
- `CzechLight/velia`
- `CzechLight/rousette`
- `CzechLight/sysrepo-ietf-alarms`

Use these `Depends-on` footer tags:
```shell
Depends-on: https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/dependencies/+/${A}
```

3) Finally, update `CzechLight/br2-external` so that it includes all changes made above.
The following `Depends-on` are needed:
```shell
Depends-on: https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/dependencies/+/${A}
Depends-on: https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/cla-sysrepo/+/${B}
Depends-on: https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/netconf-cli/+/${C}
Depends-on: https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/velia/+/${D}
Depends-on: https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/rousette/+/${E}
Depends-on: https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/CzechLight/sysrepo-ietf-alarms/+/${F}
```

If everything builds, then the change is good to go üåà ü¶Ñ üçª.

## Adding new repositories

- Create project within Gerrit: `ssh import.gerrit.cesnet.cz gerrit create-project --parent github/acl github/ORGANIZATION/REPO --owner '"Git Importers"' --description "'MIRROR: ...'"`
- Run the first import script as the `github-mirror` user on `gerrit.cesnet.cz`: `REPO=org/repo ./oneshot.sh`
- Update configuration of the `public` tenant in Zuul ([example](https://gerrit.cesnet.cz/c/ci/project-config/+/2188))
- Reconfigure Zuul (as `zuul` on `zuul.gerrit.cesnet.cz`, run `zuul-scheduler full-reconfigure`)
- Add the submodule here: `git submodule add ../../github/ORG/REPO REPO`
- Modify `ci/build.sh` to start building this dependency
- Propose changes to all consumers as shown above

## Testing experimental changes

When an upstream project fixes a bug or implements a suggestion that we asked for, their commits typically end up in their GitHub repo, but not neccessarily in a branch that we're tracking.
Also, the CI builds against a Gerrit copy of these projects, and the mirroring script only runs twice a day.
In order to test changes earlier, all CzechLight developers can push changes to branches named `cesnet/*`.
E.g., changes to `libyang` can be pushed to the repo `github/CESNET/libyang`, branch `cesnet/2020-07-24-fix-random-stuff`.
